# 19_CryptoClustering_Project

### Project Overview
This project deliverable consisted of creating 2 unsupervised learning models for cryptocurrency data (one using all the features, and another using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features in the model). The goal for each model was to find the optimal value of k(number of clusters) using the elbow curve method and then to fit and make predictions based on the optimal `k` value. Once predictions were made, the points were plotted (grouped by cluster) to see how the model performed.  

Prior to starting any of the machine learning modeling, the data first had to be scaled to help prvent bias. Once scaled, the data could be used to find the best value for `k` and then fit the model for plotting. Once both models had been created and plotted, the elbow curves and scatter plots with clusters were plotted side-by-side in order to visually compare the 2 models. Analysis is included in the jupyter notebook of the process and model comparisons.
